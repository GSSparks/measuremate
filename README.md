# MeasureMate
This repo contains a python script that will take a value and unit of measurement that you give it and convert it to the metric or imperial equivalent like a good friend should!
## Usage:
Usage is simple just call the command `mm.py 400 mm`. Your new best friend will politely reply to you what 400mm is in inches. `400.0 mm is equivalent to 15.75 in`
